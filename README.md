# InfraChainDAO

> A decentralized autonomous organization for predictive infrastructure maintenance powered by IoT sensors and Stacks blockchain.

## Project Overview
InfraChainDAO revolutionizes infrastructure maintenance by combining IoT sensors, smart contracts, and blockchain technology. Built on the Stacks ecosystem, it creates a trustless, automated system for infrastructure monitoring and maintenance coordination.

### Key Features
- üîó Smart contract-based infrastructure asset registration
- üìä Real-time IoT sensor data integration with blockchain validation
- ü§ñ Automated maintenance triggering based on sensor thresholds
- üí∞ Trustless payment distribution using STX
- ‚≠ê On-chain reputation system for contractors
- üîê Decentralized governance for maintenance standards

### Why Stacks?
InfraChainDAO leverages Stacks' unique capabilities:
- Bitcoin's security for high-value infrastructure decisions
- Clarity smart contracts for transparent maintenance logic
- STX for automated contractor payments
- Bitcoin finality for immutable maintenance records

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
1. `core-dao.clar`: Core DAO governance and asset management
2. `sensor-oracle.clar`: IoT data validation and storage
3. `maintenance.clar`: Maintenance scheduling and tracking
4. `payment-handler.clar`: Contractor payment distribution
5. `reputation.clar`: Contractor reputation management

### Key Integrations
- IoT Sensor Network
  - Data validation through oracle contracts
  - Real-time monitoring and alerts
- Contractor Marketplace
  - Reputation-based job allocation
  - Automated payment distribution
- Maintenance Protocol
  - Threshold-based triggering
  - Multi-signature completion verification

### Smart Contract Interface

```clarity
;; Asset Registration
(define-public (register-asset (asset-id uint) (params (tuple)))
    ;; Register new infrastructure assets

;; Sensor Data Integration
(define-public (update-sensor-data (asset-id uint) (reading uint))
    ;; Update and validate sensor readings

;; Maintenance Triggers
(define-public (check-maintenance-needed (asset-id uint))
    ;; Evaluate sensor data against thresholds

;; Payment Processing
(define-public (process-payment (job-id uint) (amount uint))
    ;; Handle contractor payments
```
